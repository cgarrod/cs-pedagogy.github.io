This course is a broad introduction to Computer Science Pedagogy.  This course is targeted toward students who are interested in improving their ability to teach computer science and who are interested in the science of teaching and learning.  This course is primarily organized like a Ph.D.-level seminar on computer science pedagogy but with an extensive experiential component: Students will get substantial practice developing, implementing, and testing course materials as if the instructor of a college-level computer science course. Students will also gain experience writing and preparing teaching philosophy statements and will have the opportunity to develop and enrich their teaching portfolios for applying in the academic job market.

## Grading 
Your course grade will be determined approximately as follows:
- 75% Pedagogy activities (homework, in-class presentations, etc.)
- 25% Discussion and participation

Our expectation is that we will have a small class of highly motivated students; we foresee that all actively participating students will get an A.


## Collaboration Policy 
You should read and abide by the [University Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Academic%20Integrity.htm).  Please speak with the instructors if you have any questions about the integrity of any actions (or potential actions) for this course.

## Accomodations 
If you are registered with the Office of Disability Resources, please use their online system to notify us of your accommodations. We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, consider contacting them at <access@andrew.cmu.edu>.

If you need extensions or accommodations for any other reason (e.g., conference travel, paper deadlines, etc.) please talk with the instructors as soon as possible. 


## Student Well Being 
Your first priority should always be to take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, getting enough sleep, avoiding drugs and alcohol, exercising and moving regularly, socializing, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. Make sure to reach out to your support system. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later gives the most opportunity for the best outcomes.

If you or anyone you know experience any academic stress, strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation, we encourage you to seek help. These mental health concerns or stressful events may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus at <http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/>.

If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night:

- **CaPS**: 412-268-2922
- **Re:solve Crisis Network**: 888-796-8226

If the situation is life threatening, call the police: 
- **On campus**: CMU Police: 412-268-2323 
- **Off campus**: 911


## Diversity and Inclusion 
We warmly welcome students with a wide range of backgrounds and identities in our course. We strive to make every student in this class feel safe and welcome, both because we respect you as human beings with a diverse set of experiences and because we want to make learning as accessible as possible. We are big advocates for diversity, especially in the tech field. Diverse identities promote excellence and innovation, and shape the perspectives of our students, faculty and staff. We acknowledge that computing as a field currently suffers from a lack of racial and gender diversity, and we want to make the field more broadly accessible for all people.

Each of us deserve to be welcomed, respected, and included equally. We all are responsible for creating a safe, inclusive environment both inside the classroom and outside in the campus community. Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. If something happens that makes you feel unsafe, unwelcome, or discriminated against, please let us know. 
You are always encouraged to reach out to the course instructor; we will listen and support you. 
You can email me directly, or contact us anonymously via the [general course feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiC9QK9K5RZIzGq9VzCGrvNDtfrUa5EBM2zi0jUEkQGGhhTA/viewform). You are also encouraged to reach out to the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion here if you wish to report concerns anonymously; they will then be able to take appropriate actions to support you. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:

- **Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion**: <csdi@andrew.cmu.edu>, (412) 268-2150
- **Report-It online anonymous reporting platform**: [reportit.net](http://reportit.net) *username*: tartans *password*: plaid

All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.
