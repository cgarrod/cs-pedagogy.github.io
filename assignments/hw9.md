## Assignment

- **Note**: As a reminder, you will also be finishing up your Homework Assignment as assigned last week:  Homework Assignments (week 1: draft, week 2: final version)


- Prepare a **1-week-long homework assignment & grading rubric** you would use to assess the learning goals on the CS Topic of your choice:  
    - Produce a complete draft of all homework materials you would distribute to the students, including the written assignment document and any starter code or other materials. This is the main deliverable for this task.
    
    - Prepare a grading rubric that describes how you would grade your assignment and how you intend to evaluate student work. Your grading rubric should be organized by learning goals.
    
    - In class, you will introduce your homework assignment to our class as if you were introducing it to your students in class.
        - Please come to class with copies of any handouts or other materials that you would distribute as part of your introduction.  
        - You don't need to bring any materials if you would just verbally/electronically discuss the assignment with your students.  
        - Your introduction should take 0 - 3 minutes.
    
    - Produce a short ( 2-3 paragraphs) that describes and defends the choices you made while creating your homework assignment and rubric.  Explicitly reflect on your choices in the context of the pedagogical principles discussed in this course and your learning objectives.

- Advice: 
    - The creation of a good homework assignment can be harder than it looks. You should complete (or nearly complete) your assignment as if you were a student, and expect to revise your assignment ideas (or sometimes even discard your plans and start over) before you produce a written assignment document. You should constantly keep in mind your learning goals and potentially go back and forth between changing your LO or your assessments.
