# Assignment 8 **Part 1: Due Friday Nov 3rd at 10am EST, Part 2: Due Friday Nov 10th at 10am EST**{: .label .label-red }

## Readings 
Next time, we will be discussing CS Education Research.  

- To prepare for the discussion, you should read the following blog posts that will familiarize you with CS Ed Research:
    - [Amy J. Ko, Ph.D. UW Seattle](http://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/cer)
        - Focus on the first 3 bullet points and skim the rest
    - [What’s unique about CS education compared to other DBERs?](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2019/12/23/whats-unique-about-cs-education-compared-to-other-dbers/)


- Then check the methodologies around CSEd vs Ed research:
    - In [CS Education Research](https://csedresearch.org/) website look at [Conducting Research](https://csedresearch.org/conducting-research/) and its subsections
    - Lishinski, A., Good, J., Sands, P., & Yadav, A. (2016, August). Methodological rigor and theoretical foundations of CS education research. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM conference on international computing education research (pp. 161-169). [Abstract, skim sections 1-4, skim 7-8]
    - [Educational Research Design](https://www.nursing.pitt.edu/research/center-scholarship-teaching-and-learning-nursing/educational-research-design)

- Now, comparing CS Ed research with more traditional research:
    - Read this first [CSEd vs Real Ed research](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/computing-education-research-vs-real-education-research/) and then read:
    - Example of a great paper with ed research (skim and focus on methods specifically):
        - Holstein, Kenneth, et al. "The classroom as a dashboard: Co-designing wearable cognitive augmentation for K-12 teachers." Proceedings of the 8th international conference on learning Analytics and knowledge. 2018.
    - Not a great example of ed research but standard in CS Ed research (skim and focus on methods specifically): 
        - Xhakaj, Franceska, and Chun W. Liew. "A new approach to teaching red black tree." Proceedings of the 2015 ACM Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education. 2015.
    - [Why Professors Doubt Education Research](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2018-03-07-why-professors-doubt-education-research)


- Bonus resources for you (optional):
    - To learn more about Research Methods: 
        - “The research methods knowledge base” by W. M. K. Trochim & J. P. Donnelly, third edition 
    - [Top ten computer science education research papers recognized](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-03/afcm-ttc022719.php)
    - <https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/>
    - [Mark Guzdial’s blog](https://computinged.wordpress.com/)
    - [Open Research Questions from the CS Education Research class, February 2019](https://computinged.wordpress.com/2019/03/11/research-questions-from-the-cs-education-research-class-february-2019/)


## Assignment

- **Note**: This will be a 2 week long assignment where you can bring a draft of your work (learning objectives and homework) this coming week and a final version next week.

- **Note**: The final lesson needs to be ready for the last 2 class sections of the semester, so you can bring drafts in the next 2 weeks. 


### Learning Objectives/Learning Goals
- At this point, you should have a polished set of learning goals for the topic you plan to teach and evaluate for the rest of the semester. For the remainder of the semester, you will create an assessment, grading rubric, and a 30 minute lecture for this topic, based on your learning objectives.

### Homework Assignments (Week 1: draft, Week 2: final version)

- Prepare a **1-week-long homework assignment & grading rubric** you would use to assess the learning goals on the CS Topic of your choice:  
    - Produce a complete draft of all homework materials you would distribute to the students, including the written assignment document and any starter code or other materials. This is the main deliverable for this task.
    
    - Prepare a grading rubric that describes how you would grade your assignment and how you intend to evaluate student work. Your grading rubric should be organized by learning goals.
    
    - In class, you will introduce your homework assignment to our class as if you were introducing it to your students in class.
        - Please come to class with copies of any handouts or other materials that you would distribute as part of your introduction.  
        - You don't need to bring any materials if you would just verbally/electronically discuss the assignment with your students.  
        - Your introduction should take 0 - 3 minutes.
    
    - Produce a short ( 2-3 paragraphs) that describes and defends the choices you made while creating your homework assignment and rubric.  Explicitly reflect on your choices in the context of the pedagogical principles discussed in this course and your learning objectives.

- Advice: 
    - The creation of a good homework assignment can be harder than it looks. You should complete (or nearly complete) your assignment as if you were a student, and expect to revise your assignment ideas (or sometimes even discard your plans and start over) before you produce a written assignment document. You should constantly keep in mind your learning goals and potentially go back and forth between changing your LO or your assessments.


### Lesson (Week 1: draft, Week 2: draft, Final 2 Classes of the Semester: present)

- Prepare a lesson on the advanced topic that you have chosen earlier this semester, based on your Learning Objectives. 
    - You will have 30 minutes to give your lecture.
    - Your lesson should include **some lecturing**, but should also include **at least one active learning activity**. 
        - You should incorporate at least one style of active learning activity that you have not tried yet in this class (remember, there is a list of types of activities discussed during the active learning lecture)
    - You will deliver your activity one of the two last Fridays of the semester.
