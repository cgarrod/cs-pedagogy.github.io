# Assignment 3 **Due Friday Sep 22nd at 10am EST**{: .label .label-red }

## Readings 

For this class you should read:
- From _How Learning Works_: 
    - Chapter 4: How do Students Develop Mastery?
    - Chapter 5: What Kind of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?


## Assignment

- For the lecture you gave in class on dictionaries, please write a set of learning goals (around 3-5) basing this on the discussion and reading we did on Bloomâ€™s taxonomy and on learning goals.

- Create a 10 minute, on-paper quiz that you might give at the start of the class after you delivered your 5-7 minute introduction to dictionaries.  (e.g., in a Monday/Wednesday course, if you gave your 5-7 minute intro on Monday, the quiz would be at the start of Wednesday's class.)  Please bring a paper copy of your quiz to class.
