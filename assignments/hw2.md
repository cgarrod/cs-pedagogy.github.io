## Assignment

You should **prepare a 5-7 minute introduction to dictionaries** (a.k.a. maps a.k.a. arbitrary-typed key-value storage) data structures for first-semester introductory computer science (CS1) students.  You will deliver this introduction in class on Friday (September 15st).

For a topic like dictionaries in a CS1 course, some topics covered typically include:
- Defining a dictionary as a data structure
- Explaining how a dictionary works
- Strengths and weaknesses of dictionaries
- How to insert, retrieve, update, and modify a data structure.

You won't be able to cover all these topics in a 5-7 introduction; please explain upfront which topics you plan to cover in your 5-7 minute segment.
