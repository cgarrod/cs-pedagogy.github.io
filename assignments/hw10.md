# Assignment 10 **Due Friday Dec 1st at 10am EST**{: .label .label-red }


## Assignment


- **Write** a Teaching Statement as if you were applying for one of the positions discussed in class.  

- **Note**: Some positions want a teaching statement that addresses diversity and inclusion, while others want a separate statement on diversity and inclusion. You can write your statement either way, but I suggest you address diversity and inclusion in your teaching statement.
