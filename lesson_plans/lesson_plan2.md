# Lesson Plan 2
What students had as an assignment: [Assignment 1](/assignments/hw1)


## [10 mins] Part 1: Discussion of Bain (Ch1, Ch4 and Epilogue)
- CH1: How does Bain define the best? What examples does he bring of best teachers?
- CH1: How would you define the best? What would be a teacher that was the best and why in your memory and that was the worst and why?
- CH4: What do the best teachers expect of their students? How do they behave towards their students?
    - We also want worst teacher stories! Can you share?
- E: What does Bain say about fixed intelligence vs growth mindset
- What did you find interesting or helpful to you and your teaching from this reading?
    - What did you find not helpful and why

## [30 mins] Part 2: Students Share Their HW Bullet Points
- What are some styles of teaching you have seen and experienced in the past? 
- What kind of teacher do you want to be? What will that look like?
- What questions would you need to ask and answer to know if your teaching is working?


## [20 mins] Part 3: Bain vs HLW and Research vs. Practice
- What is Bain’s approach to research/the scientific method?
    - What do you see positive in this approach? What about negative?
- What is the HWL approach?
- How do they compare and contrast against each other? [Highlight research vs Practice]
- Fran tldr: A lot of their methodology is based on cherry picking faculty & students, not rigorous methods (i.e., tagging data or interviewing, “informal” interviews), no rigorous standard or definition for what “counted” towards their assessment


## [15 mins] Part 4: Discussion of CH1 HWL: Prior Knowledge
- What is learning? What are the 7 principles of learning
- What did you find helpful or interesting that you may apply to your teaching?
- CH1: 
    - Why is prior knowledge important?
    - Example from the book or your experience on how it can help or hinder learning
        - Highlight inappropriate (analogy: boxes for vars, = in programming, folder structure), insufficient and incorrect prior knowledge
    - What strategies did you find helpful? What research was impressive here?
        - Note p29 on student self-assessment!
